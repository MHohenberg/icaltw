# icaltw

icaltw is an ical server for taskwarrior tasks.

## Goals

- provide easy two-way syncing of taskwarrior tasks with modern, iCal-using 
  devices without the need of a specialized tw client on the target device.
- map as much of TW functionality as possible.

## Project status

I just began. Make yourself a tea, and wait. Or better: Help!
